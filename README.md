# VRPG Study on  Goal Reduction and Goal Optimization

## Overview
This repository hosts the ongoing study detailed in the "VRPG for Fine Tunings Goals and Path Finding" paper. The study delves into the realm of reducing complex text to guides and optimizing goals within the context of large language models. It represents an exploratory journey into the intersection of cognitive theories and computational linguistics, striving to create a general framework for goal optimization.

## Study Highlights
- **Focus**: The study primarily focuses on transforming qualitative data into quantifiable goals, leveraging the power of large language models.
- **VRPG Model**: The core of the study revolves around the VRPG (Values, Resources, Problems, Goals) model, a novel approach to understanding and navigating the complexities inherent in setting and achieving various goals.
- **Goal Optimization**: The paper outlines methodologies for breaking down abstract goals into concrete steps and measurable outcomes.
- **Matrix and Vector Approach**: A key contribution is the development of a matrix and vector approach, adding a layer of sophistication to the analysis of how resources, values, and problems interact to influence goals.
